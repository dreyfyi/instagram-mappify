# Instagram holiday light map

This is a script I wrote for the [Tampa Bay Times](http://www.tampabay.com) that would map Instagram photos based on a certain hashtag (in this case '\#tampabayholiday'). This script can be reconfigured for any purpose and is more of a guide for people trying to use the Instagram API to create a map with thumbnail icons rather than markers.

It's what I wished I had found when I tried to make this a couple years ago as an Instagram API noob.

### What it looks like

[Check out the 2013 edition.](http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2013/graphics/tampabayholiday)

### Notes

I will be adding Twitter photos to the code when I get a chance. No solid date as of yet, but hopefully soon.

## Dependencies

The only dependency is [Miso Project's](http://misoproject.com/) [Dataset](http://misoproject.com/dataset/), and it's included here. Big shoutout to them because their Google Sheets compatability has been a godsend for me.

- jQuery
- Instagram API
- Google Maps API

## Instructions

Coming soon.
